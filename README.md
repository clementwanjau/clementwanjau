## Senior Rust Engineer. 
Wrangling lifetimes and avoiding segfaults since 2018.   
I'm not a control freak, I just prefer my code to be `memory-safe` and `thread-reliable`.   
I'm passionate about building high-performance, concurrent systems that are `struct`-urally sound.   
When I'm not battling the borrow checker, you can find me match-ing wits with cryptic error messages or `impl`-ementing my latest crazy idea.   
I'm a firm believer that generics are the spice of life, and traits make everything better.   
Let's derive some joy from clean, efficient code!
